<h2>Satchin Panda&rsquo;s biography</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1971</strong> - Born and raised in India</li>
    <li><strong>1991</strong> - Earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in agriculture, specializing in genetics
    and plant breeding, from <em>Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology</em></li>
    <li><strong>1994</strong> - Pursued a master&rsquo;s program in biotechnology at <em>Tamilnadu Agricultural University</em> and successfully graduated. Panda then decided to move to the United States and joined the graduate program at <em>The Scripps Research Institute</em> where
    he studied the circadian oscillator mechanism in plants under <em>Dr. Steve Kay</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>2011</strong> - Received his PhD and conducted postdoctoral research in <em>Dr. John Hogenesch&rsquo;s</em> lab at the Genomics
    <em>Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation</em> in San Diego. Here, he tried to understand the light input pathway along
    with circadian regulation of behavior and physiology in mammals by using genetic and genomic approaches. His work
    revealed tissue-specific circadian regulation of transcription and suggested that mammals engage multiple photoreceptors
    to adapt to their natural environment.</li>

<p>“lots of light during the day, no light at night, less noise, relatively cooler temperatures at night, and earlier
dinner. Each of these factors has been shown to contribute to better sleep.”</p>
